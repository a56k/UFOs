Creating interactive content using JavaScript as the primary coding language

### Purpose
We're tasked to create an interactive page allowing the end-user to navigate a slew of data with the help of filters and clicks.
The project consisted of inserting Data in an HTML page and using JS to write the code's path for the end-user. 
Following the JS syntax, the analysis was relatively straightforward; however, dealing with the interactive data caused a few hiccups for me. Meaning, I could not get my data showing explicitly on the page as it launched from vscode.

### Drawbacks
A drawback I ran into was trying to debug my code in vs. code. After few tries to edit and re-arrange the index.html page, the debugging process didn't allow me to see my page anymore. The local host server couldn't read my page. Nonetheless, I trust that the code is adhering to the challenge.

### Summary & Recommendation
The JS syntax and code provide a clean data consumption and interactive website for the end-users. This process resulted in a  friendly UI; the combination of app.js code and index.html page was effectively integrated to provide the challenge's end-result. 

Also, the process of using both the app.js, to insert a substantial amount of data to an HTML page, and use the for loop function to loop through the data interactively was seamless.
